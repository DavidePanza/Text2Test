      "I wish I could have had in graduate school. No one should have to learn this stuff the way I\n",
      "did. I am glad there is an audience to benefit from the book.\n",
      "It consumed five years to write it. There was an initial set of course notes, melted down\n",
      "and hammered into a first 200-page manuscript. I discarded that first manuscript. But it\n",
      "taught me the outline of the book I really wanted to write. Then, several years of teaching\n",
      "with the manuscript further refined it.\n",
      "Really, I could have continued refining it every year. Going to press carries the penalty of\n",
      "freezing a dynamic process of both learning how to teach the material and keeping up with\n",
      "changes in the material. As time goes on, I see more elements of the book that I wish I had\n",
      "done differently. I’ve also received a lot of feedback on the book, and that feedback has given\n",
      "me ideas for improving it.\n",
      "So in the second edition, I put those ideas into action. The major changes are:\n",
      "The R package has some new tools. The map tool from the first edition is still here, but\n",
      "now it is named quap. This renaming is to avoid misunderstanding. We just used it to get\n",
      "a quadratic approximation to the posterior. So now it is named as such. A bigger change is\n",
      "that map2stan has been replaced by ulam. The new ulam is very similar to map2stan, and\n",
      "in many cases can be used identically. But it is also much more flexible, mainly because it\n",
      "does not make any assumptions about GLM structure and allows explicit variable types. All\n",
      "the map2stan code is still in the package and will continue to work. But now ulam allows for\n",
      "much more, especially in later chapters. Both of these tools allow sampling from the prior\n",
      "distribution, using extract.prior, as well as the posterior. This helps with the next change.\n",
      "Much more prior predictive simulation. A prior predictive simulation means simulating\n",
      "predictions from a model, using only the prior distribution instead of the posterior distri-\n",
      "bution. This is very useful for understanding the implications of a prior. There was only a\n",
      "vestigial amount of this in the first edition. Now many modeling examples have some prior\n",
      "predictive simulation. I think this is one of the most useful additions to the second edition,\n",
      "since it helps so much with understanding not only priors but also the model itself.\n",
      "More emphasis on the distinction between prediction and inference. Chapter 5, the chap-\n",
      "ter on multiple regression, has been split into two chapters. The first chapter focuses on\n",
      "helpful aspects of regression; the second focuses on ways that it can mislead. This allows as\n",

      "It is important that readers expect that confusion is normal. This is also the reason that I\n",

      "First, I force the reader to explicitly specify every assumption of the model. Some readers\n",
      "of the first edition lobbied me to use simplified formula tools like brms or rstanarm. Those\n",

      "I don’t see how a person can come to understand the model when using those tools. The\n",
      "priors being hidden isn’t the most limiting part. Instead, since linear model formulas like\n",
      "y ~ (1|x) + z don’t show the parameters, nor even all of the terms, it is not easy to see\n",
      "how the mathematical model relates to the code. It is ultimately kinder to be a bit cruel and\n",

      "xiii\n",
      "What the book assumes. This book does not try to teach the reader to program, in the most\n",

      "recognize a loop and understand that commands can be embedded inside other commands\n",
      "(recursion). Knowing that R vectorizes a lot of code, instead of using loops, is important. But\n",
      "you don’t have to yet be confident with R programming.\n",
      "Inevitably you will come across elements of the code in this book that you haven’t seen\n",
      "before. I have made an effort to explain any particularly important or unusual programming\n",
      "tricks in my own code. In fact, this book spends a lot of time explaining code. I do this\n",
      "because students really need it. Unless they can connect each command to the recipe and\n",
      "the goal, when things go wrong, they won’t know whether it is because of a minor or major\n",

      "already. R is convenient for doing computational statistics. But many other languages are\n",
      "equally fine. I recommend Python (especially PyMC) and Julia as well. The first edition\n",

      "material. They allude to connections to other approaches, provide historical background, or call out\n",
      "common misunderstandings. These boxes are meant to be optional, but they round out the material\n",
      "and invite deeper thought.\n",
      "The Overthinking sections look like this:\n",
      "Overthinking: Getting your hands dirty. These sections, set in smaller type, provide more detailed\n",
      "explanations of code or mathematics. This material isn’t essential for understanding the main text.\n",
      "But it does have a lot of value, especially on a second reading. For example, sometimes it matters how\n",

      "HOW TO USE THIS BOOK\n",
      "xv\n",
      "Everyone knows that the command line is more powerful. But it also saves you time\n",
      "and fulfills ethical obligations. With a command script, each analysis documents itself, so\n",
      "that years from now you can come back to your analysis and replicate it exactly. You can\n",
      "re-use your old files and send them to colleagues. Pointing and clicking, however, leaves\n",
      "no trail of breadcrumbs. A file with your R commands inside it does. Once you get in the\n",
      "habit of planning, running, and preserving your statistical analyses in this way, it pays for\n",
      "itself many times over. With point-and-click, you pay down the road, rather than only up\n",
      "front. It is also a basic ethical requirement of science that our analyses be fully documented\n",
      "and repeatable. The integrity of peer review and the cumulative progress of research depend\n",
      "upon it. A command line statistical program makes this documentation natural. A point-\n",
      "and-click interface does not. Be ethical.\n",
      "So we don’t use the command line because we are hardcore or elitist (although we might\n",
      "be). We use the command line because it is better. It is harder at first. Unlike the point-and-\n",
      "click interface, you do have to learn a basic set of commands to get started with a command\n",
      "line interface. However, the ethical and cost saving advantages are worth the inconvenience.\n",
      "How you should work. But I would be cruel, if I just told the reader to use a command-line\n",
      "tool, without also explaining something about how to do it. You do have to relearn some\n",
      "habits, but it isn’t a major change. For readers who have only used menu-driven statistics\n",
      "software before, there will be some significant readjustment. But after a few days, it will\n",
      "seem natural to you. For readers who have used command-driven statistics software like\n",
      "Stata and SAS, there is still some readjustment ahead. I’ll explain the overall approach first.\n",
      "Then I’ll say why even Stata and SAS users are in for a change.\n",
      "The sane approach to scripting statistical analyses is to work back and forth between\n",
      "two applications: (1) a plain text editor of your choice and (2) the R program running in a\n",
      "terminal. There are several applications that integrate the text editor with the R console. The\n",
      "most popular of these is RStudio. It has a lot of options, but really it is just an interface that\n",

      "a circular archipelago, with 10 islands. Each island was neighbored by two others, and the\n",

      "Among these obligations, King Markov agreed to visit each island in his kingdom from time\n",
      "to time. Since the people loved their king, each island preferred that he visit them more often.\n",
      "And so everyone agreed that the king should visit each island in proportion to its population\n",
      "size, visiting the largest island 10 times as often as the smallest, for example.\n",
      "The Good King Markov, however, wasn’t one for schedules or bookkeeping, and so he\n",
      "wanted a way to fulfill his obligation without planning his travels months ahead of time. Also,\n",
      "since the archipelago was a ring, the King insisted that he only move among adjacent islands,\n",
      "\n",
      "9.1. GOOD KING MARKOV AND HIS ISLAND KINGDOM\n",
      "265\n",
      "to minimize time spent on the water—like many citizens of his kingdom, the king believed\n",
      "there were sea monsters in the middle of the archipelago.\n",
      "The king’s advisor, a Mr Metropolis, engineered a clever solution to these demands. We’ll\n",
      "call this solution the Metropolis algorithm. Here’s how it works.\n",
      "(1) Wherever the King is, each week he decides between staying put for another week\n",
      "or moving to one of the two adjacent islands. To decide, he flips a coin.\n",
      "(2) If the coin turns up heads, the King considers moving to the adjacent island clock-\n",
      "wise around the archipelago. If the coin turns up tails, he considers instead moving\n",
      "counterclockwise. Call the island the coin nominates the proposal island.\n",
      "(3) Now, to see whether or not he moves to the proposal island, King Markov counts\n",
      "out a number of seashells equal to the relative population size of the proposal is-\n",
      "land. So for example, if the proposal island is number 9, then he counts out 9\n",
      "seashells. Then he also counts out a number of stones equal to the relative popula-\n",
      "tion of the current island. So for example, if the current island is number 10, then\n",
      "King Markov ends up holding 10 stones, in addition to the 9 seashells.\n",
      "(4) When there are more seashells than stones, King Markov always moves to the pro-\n",
      "posal island. But if there are fewer shells than stones, he discards a number of stones\n",
      "equal to the number of shells. So for example, if there are 4 shells and 6 stones, he\n",
      "ends up with 4 shells and 6 −4 = 2 stones. Then he places the shells and the re-\n",
      "maining stones in a bag. He reaches in and randomly pulls out one object. If it is a\n",
      "shell, he moves to the proposal island. Otherwise, he stays put another week. As a\n",
      "result, the probability that he moves is equal to the number of shells divided by the\n",
      "original number of stones.\n",
      "This procedure may seem baroque and, honestly, a bit crazy. But it does work. The king will\n",

      "(1) Quality of theory and predictions: If most theories are wrong, most findings will be\n",

      "long-term research will not be done. If people who already have funding judge who\n",

      "(3) Quality of measurement: Research design matters, all agree; but often this is for-\n",
      "gotten when interpreting results. A persistent problem is designs with low signal-\n",
      "to-noise ratios.251 Poor signal will not mean no findings, just unreliable ones.\n",
      "(4) Quality of data analysis: The topic of this book, but still much broader than it has\n",
      "indicated. Many common practices in the sciences exacerbate false discovery.252 If\n",
      "you are not designing your analysis before you see the data, then your analysis may\n",
      "overfit the data in ways that regularization cannot reliably address.\n",

      "of it is not so good. Many mistakes get through, and many brilliant papers do not.\n",
      "Peer review selects for hyperbole, since honestly admitting limitations of work only\n",

      "allow it all back in during publication.253 Incentives for positive findings and news-\n",
      "worthy results distort the design of research and how it is summarized.254\n",
